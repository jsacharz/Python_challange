# Python-challenge

In this assigment I prepared two scripts to analyse the following data sets in csv:

## PyBank

PyBank part required analysis of the financial data in csv which captured changes in value over the period of time.
This part covered how to print the outcomes into the terminal and how to save the results in a text file.
The script I wrote used only two modules: os and csv and by using f-loop and conditonal statments it generated the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset


- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes


- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

I also saved the bank.txt file generated in the script with the output of all the results.

## PyPoll

PyPoll exercise aim to loop through a long list of candidiates and their election votes in csv.
I decided to use here the dictionaries and maybe my script looks a bit complicated but I learnt a lot while preparing it.
I found the idea on how to use function for the dictionaries and the importantce of f-loop, which in same cases needs to be repeated.
The script excratred the following data:

- The total number of votes cast


- A complete list of candidates who received votes


- The percentage of votes each candidate won


- The total number of votes each candidate won


- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I also saved the election.txt file generated in the script with the output of all the results.
